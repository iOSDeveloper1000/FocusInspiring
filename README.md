# FocusInspiring - The way of keeping inspirations ongoing

## App specification

## Project FocusInspiring - a reminder app for inspirational notes of any kind

This app allows you to store any inspiration coming up to your mind in form of text, image, screenshot, audio or video. Helping you as a reminder for your inspirations the app displays the note again after an certain period of time - adjustable by yourself for each note. According to the state of implementation, you can then decide to add the note to a *List of Glory*, redisplay after a specifiable time or archive/delete it.

This way, you are free to focus on new inspirations neither having to worry losing great ideas nor having to actively search certain lists persistently or getting disturbed by frequent notifications.

You can use this app for developing your private projects, advancing your own business or just for collecting personal motivations. These are only some examples. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
